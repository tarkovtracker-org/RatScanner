# Build and validation

## Canonical pipelines

Use the repository runner rather than reconstructing CI commands ad hoc:

```bat
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\verify.ps1 -Mode Fast
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\verify.ps1 -Mode Full
```

`Fast` restores tools/packages, checks C# and Markdown formatting plus agent-document integrity, builds Debug (including the analyzer gate), and runs App unit tests. `Full` also validates/installs the pinned runtime data, runs the adversarial script/data validators, builds/tests Release, and exercises the real WebView2 smoke suite. Both fail immediately with the underlying non-zero exit code.

## Commands

### Restore

```bat
dotnet restore RatScanner.sln
```

(`dev.bat` restores unless `-SkipRestore`.)

CI caches the global NuGet package directory using the project files and `NuGet.Config` as the key input, but still runs an explicit solution restore on every job.

### Build

```bat
dotnet build RatScanner.sln
dotnet build -c Release RatScanner.sln
```

App and tests target x64 in every configuration because the OpenCvSharp Windows native runtime is x64-only. Release omits debug symbols (see App csproj).

### Unit tests

```bat
dotnet test tests\RatScanner.Tests\RatScanner.Tests.csproj
dotnet test tests\RatScanner.Tests\RatScanner.Tests.csproj -c Release --no-build --no-restore
```

CI builds and tests Release on `windows-latest` with the SDK pinned by `global.json`.

The App unit project is `tests/RatScanner.Tests` (xUnit v3). It covers App logic and reliability contracts, configuration migration, localization fallback/key parity, and the optional App-owned capture/crop harness. RatEye's submodule owns engine/OpenCV/cache tests and fixture replay. **Neither** is a substitute for hosted UI or live-scan verification. Scoped rules: `tests/AGENTS.md`.

The real UI smoke project intentionally stays outside `RatScanner.sln`, so solution-wide build/test commands remain non-interactive. Invoke the UI project only through the explicit commands below.

### WebView2 UI smoke

RatScanner has no HTTP server. The durable browser surface is the Blazor content inside the WPF-hosted WebView2. `tests/RatScanner.UiTests` launches the built application and requests an OS-assigned CDP port plus an isolated profile through test-only environment variables that the WebView initialization event applies directly. The harness polls the resulting `DevToolsActivePort` file and attaches Playwright .NET to the `/app` target. It uses the installed WebView2 runtime, so no Playwright browser download is required.

```bat
:: Build/setup and run the committed smoke suite
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\verify.ps1 -Mode Ui

:: Repeat the lifecycle/flow three times
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\verify.ps1 -Mode Ui -Repeat 3

:: Run every committed UI/E2E test after a Release build
dotnet test tests\RatScanner.UiTests\RatScanner.UiTests.csproj -c Release --no-build --no-restore

:: The command above is headed by default because the product is a real WPF window.

:: Slow interactions for local debugging
set RATSCANNER_UI_SLOWMO_MS=500
dotnet test tests\RatScanner.UiTests\RatScanner.UiTests.csproj -c Release --no-build --no-restore
set RATSCANNER_UI_SLOWMO_MS=
```

Close any unrelated RatScanner instance first. The harness deliberately refuses to attach to or stop it. Each run uses a unique WebView2 profile and cleans up only its own process tree/profile.

The current high-signal smoke covers:

- WPF process startup and WebView2 readiness without a fixed startup sleep;
- main scan shell, semantic navigation, and the search control;
- keyboard activation/focus through Settings and a click-driven About route, including the About card's two-step vertical rhythm (text vs block spacing) and a `desktop-about.png` capture;
- desktop and 600px narrow settings rendering, responsive control swap, bounds, and horizontal overflow;
- result-card item art containment (portrait, landscape, square icons) and the Details user-action contract;
- an ARIA snapshot of the important narrow settings structure;
- uncaught page exceptions, browser console errors, failed app-resource requests, and app-resource HTTP 5xx responses.

It does not automate live EFT capture/OCR, overlay placement over the game, tray/minimal native chrome, real multi-monitor DPI transitions, authenticated TarkovTracker flows, or destructive settings changes.

### UI artifacts and trace inspection

Every run writes a unique directory under `artifacts\ui-tests\` with desktop/narrow screenshots, effective URL, accessibility snapshot, app stdout/stderr, and `RatScanner.log`. Failures additionally retain `failure.png`, DOM and accessibility snapshots, browser runtime failures, and `trace.zip` where tracing started.

Inspect a failure trace with the Playwright script emitted by the built test project. Discover the generated path so target-framework updates do not stale this command:

```powershell
$traceScript = Get-ChildItem tests\RatScanner.UiTests\bin\Release -Recurse -Filter playwright.ps1 | Select-Object -First 1
& $traceScript.FullName show-trace artifacts\ui-tests\<run>\trace.zip
```

For visual validation, inspect `desktop-scan.png` and `narrow-settings.png`; do not infer visual correctness from the test exit code alone. Pixel baselines are intentionally not enabled: OS/WebView/font rendering, local display/config text, and cache-derived status make broad pixel diffs noisy. The suite instead keeps deterministic screenshots and high-signal layout/semantic assertions. Add a small visual baseline only after stabilizing a specific high-value surface; never auto-approve a changed baseline.

### Formatting

Authoritative tool for C#: **CSharpier** as a local tool (see `dotnet-tools.json`).

```bat
dotnet tool restore
dotnet csharpier check .
dotnet csharpier format .
```

Do not invent alternate invocations solely from config files. Config: `.csharpierrc.json` (spaces, width 120, CRLF). Ignore: `.csharpierignore` (XAML, csproj, resx, bin/obj, …).

VS Code defaults to CSharpier on save for C# (`.vscode/settings.json`).

### Markdown lint

Authoritative tool: **markdownlint-cli2** via Node (dev-only `package.json`; not a product runtime dependency).

```bat
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\lint-markdown.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\lint-markdown.ps1 -Fix
npm run lint:md
npm run lint:md:fix
```

Config: `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` (CLI globs/ignores) + `.markdownlint.json` (rule set for CLI and VS Code extension). Rules of note:

- **Tables:** compact GFM style (MD055/MD060). Delimiter rows must be `| --- | --- |` (spaces around pipes), not `|---|---|` or `|--------|`. The pinned CLI in `package.json` auto-fixes this style; VS Code fix-on-save also applies once the file is open.
- **Fenced code:** language tag required (MD040) — not always auto-fixed; use `text`, `bat`, `powershell`, etc.
- **Line length (MD013):** disabled — long agent/prose lines and table cells are fine
- Script installs npm deps on first run when `node_modules` is missing

Optional local pre-commit check: `scripts\install-git-hooks.ps1`. It runs only when Markdown is staged and never rewrites or re-stages working-tree content. CI runs check mode after Node setup.

VS Code: recommend `davidanson.vscode-markdownlint`; format/fix-on-save for Markdown is enabled in `.vscode/settings.json`.

### Documentation integrity

```bat
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\check-agent-docs.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\test-agent-docs.ps1
```

The integrity check validates required paths, context routing, local Markdown links, structurally parsed MSBuild references/package versions, RatEye submodule wiring, and primary-branch consistency while excluding generated output. The adversarial test builds a disposable path-with-spaces fixture and proves representative failures are non-zero and actionable. Both run in CI.

### RatScannerData validator tests

```bat
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\test-data-validation.ps1
```

These hermetic fixtures cover checksum parsing/mismatch handling, manifest schema and count validation, required files, root/nested archive layouts, and packaged-archive verification. They do not download live data. The later packaging step downloads the pinned release and validates the real published assets.

### Release package verification

```bat
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\verify-package.ps1
```

Installation validation only proves the staged `publish\Data` tree was correct; packaging happens afterward. This runs against the archive that actually ships — reading the manifest and every manifest-listed payload byte out of the zip — so a packaging step cannot silently drop, truncate, or duplicate payload files. It also rejects duplicate entry names and entries that differ only by case, which collide on extraction on the Windows x64 target. `publish.bat` and CI both run it on the zip they just produced, before that artifact can be uploaded or promoted. Entry separators are normalized because 7-Zip writes forward slashes and `Compress-Archive` writes backslashes.

### Analyzers / warnings

```bat
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\check-analyzer-gate.ps1
```

The consistency check compares the explicit CA/IDE warning rules in `.editorconfig` with `WarningsAsErrors` in `Directory.Build.props`; CI fails if either side drifts.

- Nullable enabled on App; treat nullability seriously. RatEye (`netstandard2.0`) and the test project are not nullable-enabled yet — that is a deliberate separate migration, not an oversight.
- Implicit usings disabled on App — do not rely on global usings.
- Root `Directory.Build.props` pins `AnalysisLevel=10.0-recommended` and enables `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild`. A curated correctness/dead-code rule set is elevated to build errors via `WarningsAsErrors`; the consistency script keeps that list synchronized with the warning-severity block in `.editorconfig`. The build (Debug **and** Release, both in CI) is the analyzer gate.
- Reviewed design/cleanup signals explicitly configured outside the curated set are suggestion-level (IDE-only). Other analyzer warnings remain visible but become hard build errors only when added to the synchronized gate. IDE0051/IDE0052 findings are reviewed per case — WPF/XAML and `#if`-gated members (e.g. `SetupExceptionHandling` under Debug) can look dead under one configuration. Never blanket auto-fix them.
- `global.json` pins an SDK feature-band patch floor (`latestPatch` roll-forward); the pinned analysis level makes analyzer behavior deliberate across SDK upgrades.

### Package vulnerability / outdated checks

CI gates on the transitive .NET vulnerability audit and high/critical npm audit for the pinned Markdown tooling. The outdated report remains an intentional review command because this repository retains some versions for compatibility:

```bat
dotnet list RatScanner.sln package --vulnerable --include-transitive
dotnet list RatScanner.sln package --outdated
dotnet list tests\RatScanner.UiTests\RatScanner.UiTests.csproj package --vulnerable --include-transitive
dotnet list tests\RatScanner.UiTests\RatScanner.UiTests.csproj package --outdated
```

Interpret carefully (transitive noise). Do not upgrade casually — see `dependency-management.md`.

## Manual verification tiers

### Unit tests (automated)

Fast, headless. Prefer expanding these for pure logic (parsers, projections, pure presentation helpers).

### WebView / UI smoke (automated plus judgment)

Run the UI suite first, then use `dev.bat -Once` for native or product states outside its committed coverage:

- Main window loads Blazor shell (not stuck on “Loading…”).
- Navigation: Scan, Settings, About.
- Item search autocomplete returns results when catalog cache is warm.
- Scanner status chip shows ready/degraded appropriately.
- Theme/CSS changes: visual check for layout regressions (search bar, sidebar).
- DPI / window resize: compact header and sidebar remain usable.

### Scan regression (manual / environment)

Requires game or carefully prepared screens + correct Data:

- Name scan on inspect window.
- Icon scan with configured modifier.
- Wrong resolution / display selection → adjust settings and retest.
- Use `examples/` images only as rough references; live matching depends on Data + scale.

### Localization validation

- Switch UI language in settings; spot-check key screens.
- Missing keys fall back to key string — not acceptable for new user-facing text.
- Keep all locale files in `src/App/i18n/` aligned with `en.json` keys.

### Publish validation

```bat
publish.bat
```

Confirm:

- `publish\RatScanner.exe` starts.
- `publish\LICENSE` present.
- `publish\Data\manifest.json` is schema 1 and declares the extracted icon count.
- `publish\Data\` contains maps.json / icons / traineddata.
- The setup log confirms the pinned archive checksum and published/embedded manifest validation.
- `RatScanner.zip` created, verified by `scripts\verify-package.ps1`, and containing no temporary `Data.zip` or checksum download files.
- Single-file self-contained win-x64 matches CI intent.

CI uploads the validated `RatScanner.zip` as an immutable build artifact. The separate least-privilege Release workflow promotes that exact artifact only after verifying a successful push-triggered Build for the selected `master` commit; it does not rebuild (see `release-and-versioning.md`).

## Required checks by change category

| Change | Required | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pure logic / helpers | build + tests for covered code | csharpier |
| API client / cache | build + unit tests | manual warm/cold start smoke |
| UI Razor/CSS | build + WebView UI smoke + screenshot inspection | manual native/DPI smoke when relevant |
| RatEye processing | standalone RatEye build/tests + integrated App build | fixture replay + scan smoke if accuracy-sensitive |
| Config paths / display | build + tests | manual multi-monitor if possible |
| i18n | build | all locale files updated; UI language switch |
| CI / scripts | relevant hermetic script test + build (or script dry-run) | publish path once if packaging changed |
| RatScannerData pin / packaging | `test-data-validation.ps1` + setup against the pinned release + `verify-package.ps1` on the built zip + Release build/test | current-EFT fixture replay and clean-machine smoke |
| Agent docs / layout | `check-agent-docs.ps1` + markdown lint | `test-agent-docs.ps1` when changing the checker |
| Version / release notes | csproj version + docs | tag workflow locally understood |
| Docs only / any `*.md` | `lint-markdown.ps1 -Fix` then check; `check-agent-docs.ps1` when structure/links change | |

## Distinguishing test layers

| Layer | What it proves | What it does not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit tests | Pure functions, contracts, regressions that were encoded | Real OCR accuracy, WebView rendering, end-user scan UX |
| Build | Compiles against current TFMs/packages | Runtime asset presence beyond compile |
| WebView UI smoke | Real hosted Blazor rendering, navigation, responsive assertions, runtime health | Native chrome/tray, live game capture, all visual judgment |
| RatEye fixture replay | Recorded accuracy/latency for versioned captures | Every display/game configuration |
| Manual scan | End-to-end recognition path | Continuous regression by itself |
| Doc integrity script | Structural doc + packaging constraints | Narrative accuracy of every sentence |

Do not claim “fully tested” when only `dotnet build` succeeded.
